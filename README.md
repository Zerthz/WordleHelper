# WordleHelper
A little tool to find words for Wordle. You insert a pattern and it finds and ranks words that fit that pattern, based on how common they are in the english language.

You would need to create a MongoDB cluster to use the program since all the words are stored as such.

## WIP
Adding a filter so you can filter out letters you've already done.
